These simple shortcuts can help you to get around Windows 7 really fast. There's both 'obvious' & obscure stuff here, so take a moment to see how you fare :)

## Generally useful shortcuts

* `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` Open task manager
* `Windows Key + R` run dialog
* `Winkey + D` toggle 'show desktop'
* `Winkey + L` lock workstation
* `Winkey + E` windows explorer
* `Middle click a link (or Ctrl + Click)` load page in background tab (useful for google, reddit)
* `Middle click a tab` close tab
* `Middle click back button` open history in new tab (not for IE)
* `Ctrl + F5` clear page cache and refresh webpage (great for page errors/testing)
* `(Shift +) tab button` when filling out a form, skip to next (or previous) form field
* `Alt + (shift +) tab` switch windows forwards (or backwards)
* `Ctrl + (shift +) tab` switch tab/document forwards (or backwards)
* `Hold Shift while inserting removable media - prevents 'autorun'
* `Shift + Delete` permanently deletes files (without going to recycle bin)
* `Shift + Right click` usually adds 'experienced user' context menu options
* `F2` 'edit', renames selected file. Also used with spreadsheet cells.
* `Ctrl + Scroll` zoom web page, document, file thumbnails, or desktop icons on Vista/7
* `Ctrl + C` on any standard error dialog box - copies error report text
* `Alt + PrtScn` Copies an image of the current window to clipboard

A note on Ctrl + Shift + Esc: Ctrl + Alt + Del now brings up a 'lock this computer' dialog on Vista/7, so I suggest you learn this one. Another perk is that on a VM or a remote control app, this will open the remote (client) machine's task manager.
